# San Diego Defendant Cases -- Data Collection & Research

*An automation toolkit for building an auditable dataset of San Diego Superior Court defendant cases*

> **Audience:** Investigative journalists, public‑interest lawyers, researchers, and technically‑minded volunteers. Comfortable running Python scripts; no prior court‑data scraping experience required.

## What this has produced

Using this toolkit, we assembled every § 190.2-eligible defendant aged 18 to 25 charged
in San Diego County during the full 2003–2017 tenure of District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis.
91 defendants. A population, not a sample.

**73.2% of eligible Black defendants were charged with a special circumstance, against
52.1% of eligible non-Black defendants.**

| Gap | Rate ratio | Odds ratio | Bounded range |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21.1 points | 1.40 | 2.51 | 2.21 – 2.71 |

Roughly three of every four eligible Black defendants faced a charge carrying life without
parole or death. Roughly one of every two eligible non-Black defendants did. The bounded
range reflects every possible resolution of the two defendants whose race could not be
verified; none approaches parity. The disparity is created at charging and is not offset
at sentencing.

**Why that is actionable.** Under Penal Code § 745(a)(3), aggregate charging data is
legally operative: a defendant can establish a Racial Justice Act violation by showing he
was charged more seriously than similarly situated defendants of other races, at a
preponderance standard, with no showing of intent. The constraint has never been the law.
It is the data, which is held by the offices whose decisions are being challenged.

**Status.** These findings are *slated for use* in Racial Justice Act challenges in
Dumanis-era capital cases. Nothing in this repository has been filed in or adjudicated by
any court, and no finding has been made on it.

## 0. Core goal

**Purpose**  
This document outlines the research process and tools used by our team and volunteers to build a **transparent dataset for bias analysis**. We're building a structured, auditable dataset of San Diego Superior Court defendant cases so we can ask a set of **clear, testable questions** about fairness and consistency in charging and sentencing.

**Concretely, we're:**
- **Assembling core facts** (defendant name, birth‑year, filing date) directly from the Superior Court's public **Case Detail** pages (via the court index link).  
- **Pulling in incident dates and sentencing outcomes** from reputable local news or appellate opinions using a **custom GPT tool**.  
- **Computing exact or best‑available age at the time of the incident**, then bucketing into: Juvenile (<18), Emerging Adult (18–26), Adult (>26).  
- **Flagging any gaps or estimates** in our data (e.g., `DOB≈1993 inferred from press release`) so **nothing is hidden**.

**What questions can this dataset answer? (examples)**  
- Are juveniles or emerging adults more/less likely to receive harsher sentences?  
- Holding age and §190.2 status constant, do outcomes vary by race?  
- How often are special circumstances (§190.2) charged/applied, and do they explain sentence differences?  
- Do plea outcomes differ from trial outcomes across groups?  
- Do outcomes vary across court locations?  
- Are there shifts over time or between DA tenures?  
- Within the same case, do similarly situated co‑defendants receive different sentences?  

**Why this matters**  
Once every record has a verified incident date, a birth‑year, the sentence, and source URLs, you can pivot and filter across groups, and run statistics (rate ratios, chi‑square, logistic regression) to test for differences that are **material and reproducible**.

**Our pipeline, at a glance**  
Court lookup → Claude‑assisted news/legal research → Derived fields (ages, bands, §190.2 status) → QC flags.

## Impact — Time & Scale

Doing this work **fully manually** would take ~500–700 hours (3–4 months full-time).  
With this toolkit, the process takes **~25–40 hours total** — compressing months into **a matter of weeks**.

- **Step 1 (Court lookups):** ~45–65 hours manually → **4–8 hours automated**  
- **Step 2 (Incident research & sentencing outcomes):** ~450–650 hours manually → **8–15 hours with GPT assistance**  
- **Manual QC:** ~10–20 hours  
- **Total reduction:** ~90% less effort while keeping auditability and transparency.

This scale shift makes systematic, reproducible fairness analysis feasible for small research teams, journalists, and advocates.

## 1. Overview — Why this exists

### Background (plain English)
This toolkit supports research into potential **racial bias in defendant sentencing**, specifically examining how **age intersects with race** in defendant case outcomes.

- **Research Question:** Does sentencing vary by race for defendants who were **juveniles (<18)** or **emerging adults (18–25)** when they committed serious incidents in San Diego?  
- **Data Scope:** Approximately 1,300 case numbers covering San Diego defendant cases.  
- **Key variables:** demographics, incident details, outcomes, age analysis, filing dates, locations, and docket links.

### 1.1 The real‑world problem
Public defendant court records in California are **fragmented** across court index pages, opinions, and news. For fairness work, you need the same fields consistently, backed by links.

### 1.2 Our design goals
- **Auditability:** Every row has URLs and notes.  
- **Reproducibility:** Given the same input, another team should produce the same sheet.  
- **Accessibility:** Uses Excel, not databases.  
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop:** Avoids full automation; humans make the final call.

### 1.3 Why age and §190.2 matter
- **Age at incident** defines Juvenile / Emerging Adult / Adult.  
- **Special circumstances (Penal Code §190.2)** determine punishment exposure.

### 1.4 Workflow grounding
Each Step 2 session starts from the docket, attaches evidence, and produces JSON with sources.

### 1.5 What this unlocks
- Spot patterns (sentence distributions, presence/absence of §190.2).  
- Retrace any row back to a document.  
- Extend later with new counties, columns, or analyses.

### 1.6 Guardrails
- Don’t confuse incident date with filing/sentencing date.  
- Prefer official sources over media.  
- Confirm defendant identity when multiple exist.

## 2. What the toolkit does

This repo contains a **hybrid automation** that removes ~85–90% of manual toil:

- **Court Data Extraction** — fetches defendant case basics into a spreadsheet.  
- **GPT‑Assisted Research** — semi‑automated, fills in incident dates, sentences, and sources.  
- **Human Oversight** — compute ages, assign bands, resolve conflicts, mark confidence.

---

## 3. Who should use this

- Investigative journalists and data editors  
- Public‑interest lawyers and policy advocates  
- Researchers who need a reproducible audit trail

---

## 4. What data we collect

- **Defendant**: name, birth year, race (if available)  
- **Court**: case number, filing date, location, docket URL  
- **Incident**: incident date, incident type  
- **Outcome**: sentence, plea vs. trial, juvenile vs. adult court  
- **Derived**: age at incident, age band  
- **Provenance**: URLs, notes, confidence

---

## 5. Ethics, transparency, and auditability

- Every fact is source‑linked.  
- Verification order: appellate decisions → trial/official docs → DA/LE releases → major newspapers → local outlets → general news.  
- Leave fields blank if not verifiable; mark confidence accordingly.

## 7.1 Workflow Summary — Step 1 and Step 2

This toolkit works in **two main steps**, with each step documented in its own folder:

- **Step 1 — Court Data Extraction**  
  Runs a Playwright-based script that fetches case details by case number and writes them into an **Excel spreadsheet**.  
  Populated columns typically include: **CaseNumber, DefendantName, DOB (year), DateFiled, CaseLocation, Source_DocketURL**.  
  The sheet also contains **predefined columns** that are present but intentionally **left blank** for later completion (e.g., **IncidentDate, Sentence, ChargesConvicted, DefendantRace, PleaOrTrial, SpecialCircumstance, Source_ArticleURL, Notes, Confidence, CaseSummary**).  
  Any spreadsheet **formulas** (e.g., *AgeAtIncident*, *AgeBand*) will automatically compute **once their input fields (like IncidentDate)** are filled later.

- **Step 2 — GPT-Assisted Research**  
  Uses a transparent, versioned prompt plus your manual oversight to find **incident dates, sentences, charges, and source links** from appellate opinions, official documents, and reliable news.  
  You paste the JSON output into the spreadsheet to **fill those existing blank fields**.  
  Step 2 **does not add new columns**; it helps complete the ones already defined in the sheet.

Together, these two steps turn a raw list of case numbers into a **complete, auditable dataset** ready for fairness and bias analysis.

---

## 8. Expected success rates

- Court data extraction: 95–98% rows populated  
- GPT‑assisted research: 75–90% (case‑coverage dependent)  
- Fully complete records: 70–85%  
- Manual follow‑up required: 15–30%

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **Session test failed** → Refresh `JSESSIONID`.  
- **GPT finds nothing** → Try nickname variations, check DateFiled.  
- **Rate limiting** → Pause 10–15 minutes. Run in batches.  
- **Excel won’t open** → Use auto‑generated backups in `output/backups/`.

---

## 10. Time & cost expectations

- Setup: 2–3 hours  
- Step 1: 4–8 hours for ~1,300 cases (unattended)  
- Step 2: 8–15 hours with human input  
- Manual QC: 10–20 hours  
- ChatGPT usage: Plus may help for uninterrupted runs
